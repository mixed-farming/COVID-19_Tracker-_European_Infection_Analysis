Tracking Daily COVID-19 Infection Count in European Countries using Hadoop MapReduce and Python

## Description
The project aims to harness the power of Hadoop MapReduce and Python to track and analyze the daily COVID-19 infection count in European countries. By utilizing the distributed processing capabilities of Hadoop, we can efficiently handle large volumes of data and extract meaningful insights.

## Steps
- Collecting reliable COVID-19 data for European countries (WHO here).
- Preparing and formatting data for Hadoop MapReduce.
- Setting up Hadoop for distributed processing.
- Implementing MapReduce job in Python.
- Analyzing daily COVID-19 infections in European countries.

## Results
